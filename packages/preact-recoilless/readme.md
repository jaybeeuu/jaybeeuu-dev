Provides hook bindings to allow
[recoilless](../recoilless/readme.md)
to be used in a
[preact](https://preactjs.com/)
application.

Most important are [`useValue`](./src/use-value.spec.tsx) and [`useAction`](./src/use-action.spec.tsx).
They are pretty simple. Have a look at the (linked) unit tests for examples of how to use them.
