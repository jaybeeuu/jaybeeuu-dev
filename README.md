### What is this repository for? ###

This repo contains my website - designed to be a sort of virtual business card. It won't be of much interest to many people but me. I have made it public in order that people can see an example  of my work.

### How do I get set up? ###

Just copy the lot into a webserver and make sure index.html is one of the default page options. Or you  can see it in action at www.joshuawallace.co.uk

### Contribution guidelines ###

I have only really made this public in order to allow people to see my work; it's not the sort of thing i expect people to want tot contribute to.

### Who do I talk to? ###

I am Josh Wallace, you can talk to me about this repo - start at www.joshuawallace.co.uk (the live version of this site) and head for the contact page.
