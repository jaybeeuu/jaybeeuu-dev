					<div class="tile-short-description">The building blocks of professional, stylish web and intranet applications, learning these has been both fun and rewarding.</div>
					<div class="tile-description">
						<h2>HTML & CSS</h2>
						<p>You cannot work with web products without developing skills in HTML and CSS.</p>
						<p>Having taught myself the syntax and techniques I have been using it professionally and personally for two years. Working with a variety of products using the backbone of all browser based applications</p>

					<div class="tile-title">ASP.NET (MVC)</div>
					<div class="tile-short-description">I have successfully leveraged my knowledge of this powerful server side technology during many projects.</div>
					<div class="tile-description">
						<h2>ASP.NET (MVC)</h2>
						<p>The ability to Create the server side of powerful web applications became a necessary part my skill set shortly after starting to work as a programmer full time.</p>
						<p>Since the company I worked for had a strong web product in their portfolio almost all the projects I have worked on have involved some variety of ASP. I therefore have experience working with Classic ASP, ASP.net and ASP.Net MVC.</p>

					<div class="tile-short-description">The core of my programming skills I have worked with all major versions of this language.</div>
					<div class="tile-description">
						<h2>C#</h2>
						<p>I started programming Pascal in college when I studied computing. During university I continued to develop my skills writing in Visual Basic and LabView several simulations culminating in my final year project.</p>
						<p>When I graduated I began to work for a software company, testing and began to teach myself C#. Having mastered the syntax and keywords I moved from the testing team into the development team and began to learn how to programme.</p>
						<p>Two years later I have been leveraging this powerful object oriented language to successfully contribute to many client server and web based projects.</p>

					<div class="tile-title">SOLID</div>
					<div class="tile-short-description">Excellent programming is about more than just syntax and reserved words. SOLID principles give me a firm basis for developing maintainable and effective code.</div>
					<div class="tile-description">
						<h2>SOLID</h2>
						<p>A big part of my mission as a programmer has always been not just to "be able to do it", but to "be able to do it in the right way". A quality programmer is not just the one with the most keywords memorised or an uncanny ability to use obscure syntax, but one able to produce readable, maintainable, extendible & durable code quickly and efficiently.</p>
						<p>In order to learn the "right way" I have spent a long time studying the SOLID principles which are an industry recognised method of doing just that. During this quest I have taken courses, read books talked to colleagues and friends and generally made it my business to understand as much as possible about the SOLID methodology.</p>

					<div class="tile-short-description">Unleashing the power of JavaScript with the full weight of cross browser compatibility jQuery is now at the heart of my skill base.</div>
					<div class="tile-description">
						<h2>jQuery</h2>
						<p>These days is is almost impossible to work with JavaScript for very long without coming into contact and seeing the enormous benefits of using the JavaScript library to streamline and ease the development process.</p>
						<p>From cross-browser compatibility to all the exciting animations and effects, not made possible, but made so much easier with JQuery, the benefits are obvious. I made it my business to learn very shortly after picking up JavaScript.</p>
						<p>During personal development projects during the in the last 2 years including this site I have become very familiar with JQuery and can use it's powerful library to greatly improve websites.</p>

				<div id="javaScript" class="tile">
					<div class="tile-title">JavaScript</div>
					<div class="tile-short-description">The use of this more dynamic language has demonstrated to me the power of client side scripting at it's best.</div>
					<div class="tile-description">
						<h2>JavaScript</h2>
						<p>Client side scripting has become an integral part of many applications and developing an intimate knowledge of JavaScript quickly became a must during my work. Now both at home and in the office I exercise my skills to produce exciting and interesting results!</p>

					<div class="tile-title">SCM</div>
					<div class="tile-short-description">The heart of any collaborative development process is it's source code management.</div>
					<div class="tile-description">
						<h2>Source Code Management</h2>
						<p>I have three years of experience working with the TFS 2010 integrated tightly with Visual Studio. During that time I worked with everything from branching to build processes.</p>
						<p>In my personal development I have also been using Git to store my code and manage changes and branching with repos hosted in Git Hub and more recently BitBucket.</p>
						<p>Both are powerful solutions to SCM and I have a working knowledge of each.</p>

					<div class="tile-short-description">Modern applications require modern data storage mechanisms.</div>
					<div class="tile-description">
						<h2>T-SQL</h2>
						<p>My T-SQL skills began with the need to set up test data and diagnose bugs during my testing days and were honed during the beginning of my transition into the development team while creating a reporting solution for our product.</p>
						<p>This baptism of fire has given me a deep understanding of the design and operation of transactional and analytical databases and an intimate knowledge of Microsoft's Transact-SQL language.</p>
