					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>My name is Josh Wallace. I am an active professional software engineer wide a wide skill set based around the Microsoft stack and web technologies. My career in IT started in software testing but I quickly realised I wanted to be working more closely with the code rather than the results. I taught my self C# and made the move into the development team. Since then I have worked on a variety of projects both web, server and client based gaining valuable experience.</p>
					<p>When I am not programming I have a real passion for learning new skills, turning my hands to cabinet making, playing guitar and Tae Kwon Do.</p>
					<h3>Philosophy</h3>
					<p>I firmly believe there is more to being a programmer than syntax and keywords. To me being more than just a coding monkey involves understanding the right way to do things to produce extendible, maintainable, readable code that does the job elegantly and performantly.</p>
					<p>My aim with everything I do is to be constantly improving. To this end I am always asking, reading, learning and trying new things. In my programming this is demonstrated by the way I approach problems with a flexible tool set which is constantly evolving to include new languages, libraries, methods and patterns.</p>
