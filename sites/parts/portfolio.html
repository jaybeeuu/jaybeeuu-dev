							<p>The aim of this project was to allow users to easily copy data from third party applications into our product with the simple click of a button.</p>
							<p>I was the only developer working on this exciting project, responsible for researching and choosing the best tool kit available,designing the product, developing, documenting and training the projects team in it's use.</p>
							<p>Written in C# this easily configurable and deployable little app sat in the task bar, waiting for the opportunity to help the users out.</p>

							<h2>Business Intelligence</h2>
							<p>This was the first major development project that I worked on. And it was a big one.</p>
							<p>From the initial R&D and requirements gathering I was responsible for designing, developing testing and delivering a reporting tool to put us in front of the competition.</p>
							<p>Making use of SQL Server Reporting Services, ASP pages for integration into our web product and T-SQL for the database side of things this project used a range of skills outside of my usual comfort zonees.</p>
							<p>With the help an mentorship of more experienced developers I was able to successfully design and build an extensive set of reports which took data from the data warehouse I aided in designing</p>

							<p>More than just an opportunity for me to promote myself this website has been a chance to explore featues of jQuery, HTML 5 and CSS 3 that I have previously not used.</p>
							<p>I have designed and built the whole thing myself, making use of as little third code as possible. In fact aside from the jQuery library itself the only code used here that someone else has written is the plugin used to customised the scroll bars.</p>
							<p>If you want to check out the source code for it you can find it on my BitBucket repo <a href="https://bitbucket.org/JaySeeAre/joshuawallace.co.uk">here</a>.</>
							<p>Be sure to checkout some of the cooler features such as the self authored Tiles jQuery plugin and the other code reuse methods such as the AJAXed page content and JavaScript classes.

							<h2>Word EDF</h2>
							<p>Making use of the VSTO tool-set, ASP and some COM+ objects the Word EDF project aimed to allow users to view and upload letters created based on a template with a minimal client footprint.</p>
							<p>Taking a lead role in the development of this project I was responsible for writing the ASP pages used to start the process, the C++ COM objects used to create the documents, the Word tool-bar ribbon forming the office integration and then the ASP pages used to receive the final document.</p>
							<p>Working on this project gave me an insight into the inner workings of a web based application and the ways in which it communicates with the ecosystem of supporting applications around it.</p>

							<h2>Operations Console</h2>
							<p>During this project I worked as part of a small team of developers on the new release of a server side product. Making use of Windows services and a User Interface hosted in MMC Operations console keeps the customers workflow running on the server.</p>
							<p>Written in C# and making full use of the powerful .NET libraries working on this product gave me an experience working on the inner workings and architecture of enterprise grade services.</p>
