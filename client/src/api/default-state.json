            "description": "This is English Bay Park, on the north west corner of Vancouver. The standing stone figure is a modern an inuksuk (plural inuksuit) tranditionally built by the Inuit, IÃ±upiat, Kalaallit, Yupik, and other peoples of the Arctic region of North America. This region, above the Arctic Circle, is dominated by the tundra biome and has areas with few natural landmarks. The inuksuk may have been used for navigation, or as a marker for travel routes, fishing places, camps, hunting grounds, places of veneration or food caches. This one was built by Alvin Kanak in 1986.",

            "description": "The Lions Gate Bridge, opened in 1938, officially known as the First Narrows Bridge, is a suspension bridge that crosses the first narrows of Burrard Inlet. The term \"Lions Gate\" refers to The Lions, a pair of mountain peaks north of Vancouver. Northbound traffic on the bridge heads in their general direction. A pair of cast concrete lions, designed by sculptor Charles Marega, were placed on either side of the south approach to the bridge in January 1939.",
